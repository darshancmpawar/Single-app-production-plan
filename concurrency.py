"""
Concurrency gates — bound heavy ML operations so concurrent users don't crash
the runtime or contend on shared TensorFlow state.

Why this is needed:
  - Streamlit Cloud runs ONE Python process. Every user session is a thread
    inside that process, so they share `tf` state and the model cache.
  - TF inference under unbounded parallelism saturates a 1 CPU / 1 GB tier
    fast and the kernel OOM-kills Streamlit.

What we expose:
  predict_gate()  — bounded semaphore; caps concurrent predict loops.
  cache_lock()    — guards ml_core._model_cache against TOCTOU on first load.
  GateBusy        — raised on timeout; UI shows a clean retry message.

Tunable via env:
  MAX_CONCURRENT_PREDICTS  default 2   (per Streamlit process)
  PREDICT_TIMEOUT_SEC      default 30
